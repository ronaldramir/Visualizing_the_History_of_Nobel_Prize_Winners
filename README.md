## Overview

The Nobel Prize has been one of the most prestigious international awards since 1901, honoring individuals and organizations for their extraordinary contributions in various fields including Chemistry, Literature, Physics, Physiology or Medicine, Economics, and Peace. This project analyzes a dataset of Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023, obtained from the Nobel Prize API, to explore patterns and answer key questions about the laureates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in the `nobel.csv` file located in the `data` folder. It contains information on all Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023, including their names, birth countries, gender, award year, and category.

1. **What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?**
2. **Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?**
3. **Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?**
